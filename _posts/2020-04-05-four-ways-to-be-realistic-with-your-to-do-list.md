You are worth so much more than the size of your crossed off to do list. But goodness knows those lists can also help in the time of decluttering or other pressing matters.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Have an unending to do list? Feel like you are never on top of things? ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣Today on the blog I'm going to leave you with some to do list tips I read in a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/02/20/how-to-put-together-a-realistic-to-do-list-every-day/#4476afb519e3) that were simple and practical:⁣

## Keep things simple

Keep things simple. Focusing on three things or less is what is recommended.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Otherwise, you'll end up with a ton on your list and that will just lead to overwhelm and perhaps the feeling of failure since you set your expectations too high!

## Write your list in advance

Write your list in advance, ideally the night before. It allows for direction and clarity going forward.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

## Start right away when you have the most energy

Start right away in the morning when you have the most energy. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣I remember reading in Mel Robbin's book [The Five Second Rule](www.melrobbins.com) about how she shares that mornings are when we have the most energy. The first few hours of the day! So, get your productive to do list juices going as soon as possible basically.

## Do a brain dump

Do a brain dump if you feel the need to have a massive to do list and then set aside to reflect and look on in the future. ⁣⁣I use to do lists for a lot of things and keep running lists of them for future reference. But, my daily to do list is written in my [bullet journal planner](www.bulletjournal.com).

⁣Helpful? ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

If you liked these tips and love your to do lists or want to get better at them, learning the simple bullet journal method may be for you too! I have some great links to get you started with using this method if that sounds like something that would be helpful. Feel free to send me an email at eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com for those links. Cheers!
