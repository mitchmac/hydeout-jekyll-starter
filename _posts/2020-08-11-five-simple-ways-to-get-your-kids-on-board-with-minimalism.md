Getting my kids on board with doing less has been easy for us because that's how we naturally are as a family (homebodies for life), but having my kids learn about the value of having less stuff is going to take longer term. It’ll be one little lesson at a time. Today on the blog, I'm sharing five simple ways to get your kids on board with minimalism. 

1. **Start somewhere.** There are so many ways to go about getting kids on board with minimalism, but the most important thing? Start somewhere. One way is with starting with small categories. i.e. dinky cars. You could, for instance, reduce the amount (such as by a chosen number to keep or by reducing similar looking cars). This has worked really well for my boys. It's very tangible for them. 
2. **Model.** Anytime you are decluttering your things, share about it! Involve them in the process. Tell them about why you are decluttering something. 
3. **Small habits.** Small habits of learning to put things back to their "[homes](https://konmari.com/how-to-eliminate-clutter/)" when you tidy up. I like to point out that when we make this a habit and have less stuff, it's so much quicker for us to do and gives us more time for rest and play. 
4. From [this blog](https://abundantlifewithless.com/raising-minimalist-kids/), another simple way is by prioritizing.

> "Prioritize what needs to go immediately and hold off on what will go naturally." 

I see this as prioritize the now and slowly get better over time….as well as what will leave the house naturally such as baby items.

5. Rachel Jones over at [Nourishing Minimalism](https://nourishingminimalism.com/how-to-get-the-kids-on-board-with-decluttering-the-toys/) talks about the value of space. And limiting space for their things so it won’t easily overflow. In my boy’s room, for instance, they have two milk crates for wooden train tracks and a few other things. It also makes it a lot faster for them cleaning up to have less!

PS I just love Joshua Becker’s [Clutterfree with Kids](https://amzn.to/2XMV06I) book! If you're new to minimalism/decluttering and have kids, this book is a great place to start or even fine tune your methods.

_PPS a while back I put together a freebie for my mail list called "The Simple Guide to Maintenance Decluttering with Kids". It gives you five simple steps to staying on top of the clutter with kids going forward. If you’d like that, I’d be happy to send that to you for free. Send me an email at_ [_eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _if you’d like that!_

Cheers,

Kelly
