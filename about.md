**Who is East Coast Kelly?**

Hi, I'm Kelly Briggs! I'm a mother of four children - three boys, one baby girl - and our family lives on the beautiful east coast of Canada. And boy, have the past nine years of my life been a whirlwind. I went from teaching elementary to staying home with my then two children. Through those years, I've built one, now two busy online businesses that I've been able to work alongside my growing family. Making it work in the pockets of my day and helping me to be able to do more than just housework (although that's needed too!). And finding fullfillment in that. I've found that the busier I've become and as my children age, that it's become even more important to figure out what is most important to me. Living simply has helped me to reduce stress, increased our finances, made more meaningful memories, stronger connections with my people, and helped me go for my DREAMS and more.

It has been through my children that I have been inspired to learn how to effectively manage my time and to simplify in all areas of life and I can't wait to share with you tips that I've found and learned to help you out! Thank you for popping by. Happy to share with you.
